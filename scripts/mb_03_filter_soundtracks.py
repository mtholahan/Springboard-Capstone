mb_03_filter_soundtracks.py

Filters joined MusicBrainz data to include only soundtrack-related entries.

- Loads the full joined release group dataset
- Filters where secondary_type_name == 'Soundtrack'
- Saves as both TSV (readable) and Parquet (performance)

Outputs:
- D:/Temp/mbdump/soundtracks.tsv
- D:/Temp/mbdump/soundtracks.parquet

Used by:
- match_05_fuzzy_afi_mb.py (for matching TMDb titles to MB soundtracks)
