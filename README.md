Musical Diversity in Movies

Overview

This repository contains the capstone project for my Springboard Data Engineering Bootcamp. The project, Musical Diversity in Movies, explores the diversity of musical genres in films by integrating and analyzing data from multiple sources, including MusicBrainz and IMDb.

Project Goal

The goal of this project is to examine the representation and variety of musical genres used in films over time, identifying trends and correlations between movie characteristics and their soundtracks.

Data Sources

MusicBrainz: A comprehensive music metadata database.

IMDb: A vast dataset of movie metadata, including genres, release years, and production details.

Additional Sources: Other open datasets related to film soundtracks and musical genres.
