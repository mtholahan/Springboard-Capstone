🎬 Musical Diversity in Movies: A Capstone Proposal 🎶

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze how musical genres in movie soundtracks correlate with critical and audience reception over time. By integrating data from MusicBrainz (primary source) and Rotten Tomatoes/IMDb, we will explore trends in soundtrack composition and their relationship with movie ratings.

🎭 Problem Statement

Soundtracks play a significant role in shaping the identity and emotional impact of movies. While music enhances storytelling, its relationship with a film's critical and audience reception remains largely unexplored.

Key Questions:

🎼 How have musical genres in film soundtracks evolved over time?📊 Do films with diverse soundtracks tend to receive higher ratings?🏆 Which soundtrack genres are most common in critically acclaimed films?🎬 Which directors and composers experiment most with musical diversity?

By analyzing these questions, this project will provide valuable data-driven insights for filmmakers, music supervisors, and film historians.

👥 Context and Client Use Case

Understanding soundtrack trends and their potential influence on film reception is valuable for:

🎬 Filmmakers & Music Supervisors – To see how soundtrack trends impact film reception.

🎼 Composers – To understand which soundtrack styles are most commonly associated with high-rated films.

📽️ Film Historians – To analyze changes in soundtrack composition over time.

This project provides insightful, data-driven trends in film music, helping industry professionals make informed decisions.

🏆 Criteria for Success

✔️ Successfully ingesting, cleaning, and storing at least 1,000 movie soundtrack records.✔️ Correlating soundtrack genre diversity with IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes scores and visualizing trends.✔️ Identifying at least 3-5 major trends in soundtrack composition over time.✔️ Building an interactive dashboard showcasing findings.

📚 Datasets

🎵 MusicBrainz – Provides structured metadata on songs, artists, and genres.

🎥 TMDb & IMDb – Offers metadata, including movie ratings and user reviews.

🔖 Last.fm – User-generated tags for refining genre classifications.

🔗 Proposed Architecture

Extract – Query MusicBrainz, TMDb, IMDb, and Last.fm APIs to collect movie metadata, soundtrack data, and genre tags.

Transform – Clean and normalize genre labels across datasets, deduplicate records, resolve inconsistencies in movie titles.

Load – Store structured data in Azure SQL Server, scaling to Apache Spark in Phase 2 for large-scale processing.

Analyze – Query datasets to compare genre diversity with movie ratings.

Visualize – Use Power BI or Tableau to display trends.
