    "# ‚úÖ Step 4: Column Homogeneity Checks and Data Preparation\n",

    "\n",
    "## Q1. Is the data homogenous in each column?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. All columns across the MusicBrainz and TMDb tables were evaluated using both Python and SQL-based homogeneity checks. Results are documented in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capstone_Step_4_Analysis.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "Every column in the cleaned datasets was consistent in data type, and outliers or mixed types were identified and remediated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. How do you anticipate this data will be used by data analysts and scientists?\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset enables:\n",
    "- Genre-based trend analysis on movie soundtracks\n",
    "- Popularity scoring by genre, year, or media type\n",
    "- Machine learning applications for popularity or genre prediction\n",
    "- Linking of movie data to soundtrack metadata for downstream modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. What does this tell you about how the data should be stored?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PostgreSQL** was used for relational modeling, joins, and indexing.\n",
    "- **Parquet** format may be used for long-term archival, fast I/O, and external analysis.\n",
    "- Columnar storage (Parquet) is optimal for slicing data by genre, year, or popularity.\n",
    "- Foreign key-based normalization ensures efficient storage and reduced duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. What cleaning steps did you perform?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaned `.tsv` files using `02_mb_cleanse_tsv_files.py`\n",
    "- Audited structure using `01_mb_audit_raw_files.py` and `03_util_inspect_fieldnames.py`\n",
    "- Normalized title casing and removed noise terms using `clean_title()`\n",
    "- Dropped or flagged soundtrack titles with mojibake, overly generic names, or duplicates\n",
    "- Standardized null handling with `\\N` and UTF-8 encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5. What wrangling did you perform for enrichment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fetched metadata using `06_tmdb_fetch_movies.py` and `07_tmdb_enrich_movies.py`\n",
    "- Used `08_tmdb_enrich_afi.py` to enrich AFI 100 manually and validate logic\n",
    "- Genres were normalized using `09_tmdb_normalize_genres.py`\n",
    "- Soundtrack-to-movie matches were made using `10_match_fuzzy_link_soundtracks.py` via:\n",
    "  - Manual match\n",
    "  - Substring match\n",
    "  - Alt-title + fuzzy match (with RapidFuzz)\n",
    "\n",
    "All enrichment steps are documented and reproducible in the pipeline.\n",
