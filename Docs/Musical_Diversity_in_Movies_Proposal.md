Musical Diversity in Movies: A Capstone Proposal

Project Overview

The project aims to analyze and visualize the diversity of musical genres in movie soundtracks over time. By integrating data from MusicBrainz (primary source) and enriching it with complementary datasets, this project will explore how genre diversity correlates with movie success metrics, such as box office revenue or critical acclaim.

Problem Statement

Soundtracks play a significant role in shaping the identity and emotional impact of movies, yet the diversity of genres used in films remains underexplored. Filmmakers and music supervisors could benefit from insights into how musical diversity impacts audience reception and critical success.

Datasets

MusicBrainz:

Provides detailed metadata on songs, artists, and genres.

Use: As the primary dataset for song and genre information.

The Movie Database (TMDb):

Extensive metadata about movies, including ratings and reviews.

Use: To connect songs to movies and gather movie-related data.

Last.fm:

User-generated tags for refining genre classifications.

Use: To enhance the genre metadata from MusicBrainz and TMDb.

Project Objectives

Build a scalable data pipeline to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from MusicBrainz, TMDb, and Last.fm.

Enrich movie soundtrack data with additional metadata from complementary sources.

Analyze genre diversity trends over time and their relationship to movie success metrics.

Create visualizations to showcase findings, such as:

Trends in genre diversity for award-winning films.

Most and least diverse genres in movies over decades.

Expected Outcomes

A clear understanding of how musical diversity has evolved in movie soundtracks.

Insights into the potential impact of genre diversity on a movieâ€™s success.

Tools & Technologies

Data Ingestion: MusicBrainz, TMDb, and Last.fm APIs.

Data Processing: Python, PostgreSQL (local prototype), Apache Spark (scaling in Phase 2).

Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
