Musical Diversity in Movies: A Capstone Proposal

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze how musical genres in movie soundtracks correlate with critical and audience reception over time. By integrating data from MusicBrainz (primary source) and Rotten Tomatoes/IMDb, we will explore trends in soundtrack composition and their relationship with movie ratings.

Problem Statement

Soundtracks play a significant role in shaping the identity and emotional impact of movies. While music enhances storytelling, its relationship with a film's critical and audience reception remains largely unexplored. This project will analyze:

How musical genres in film soundtracks have evolved over time.

Whether films with more diverse soundtracks tend to receive higher ratings.

Which soundtrack genres are most common in critically acclaimed films.

Which directors and composers tend to experiment with musical diversity.

By examining these questions, this project will provide valuable insights for filmmakers, music supervisors, and film historians.

Context and Client Use Case

Understanding soundtrack trends and their potential influence on film reception is valuable for:

Filmmakers & Music Supervisors: To see how soundtrack trends impact film reception.

Composers: To understand which soundtrack styles are most commonly associated with high-rated films.

Film Historians: To analyze changes in soundtrack composition over time.

This project provides data-driven insights into film music trends, helping creatives make informed decisions about soundtrack composition.

Criteria for Success

Success will be measured by:

Successfully ingesting, cleaning, and storing at least 1,000 movie soundtrack records.

Correlating soundtrack genre diversity with IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes scores and visualizing trends.

Identifying at least 3-5 major trends in soundtrack composition over the decades.

Building an interactive dashboard showcasing findings.

Datasets

MusicBrainz:

Provides structured metadata on songs, artists, and genres.

Use: Extract soundtrack genre information for films.

The Movie Database (TMDb) & IMDb:

Offers metadata, including movie ratings and user reviews.

Use: Correlate soundtrack genres with critical and audience reception.

Last.fm:

User-generated tags for refining genre classifications.

Use: Enhance and normalize genre data from MusicBrainz.

Proposed Architecture

Extract:

Query MusicBrainz, TMDb, IMDb, and Last.fm APIs to collect movie metadata, soundtrack data, and genre tags.

Transform:

Clean and normalize genre labels across datasets.

Deduplicate records and resolve inconsistencies in movie titles.

Load:

Store structured data in Azure SQL Server.

Scale to Apache Spark in Phase 2 for large-scale processing.

Analyze:

Query datasets to compare genre diversity with movie ratings.

Visualize:

Use Power BI or Tableau to display trends.

Technologies Used

Programming & Data Processing: Python, SQL

Data Storage: Azure SQL Server (primary), Apache Spark (scalable processing in Phase 2)

Cloud Platform: Azure

Version Control: Git & GitHub

ETL & Pipeline Management: Python-based ETL, Dockerized pipeline for deployment

Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deliverables

GitHub Repository containing:

Python scripts & Jupyter Notebooks for ETL processing.

Azure SQL schema & queries.

Power BI/Tableau Dashboards visualizing trends.

README file documenting findings.

Final Slide Deck summarizing insights.

This revised proposal ensures full alignment with Step 2 requirements, with Azure SQL Server as the backend and Apache Spark as a potential Phase 2 enhancement. The addition of containerization makes the ETL process scalable and modern, aligning with real-world data engineering practices.
